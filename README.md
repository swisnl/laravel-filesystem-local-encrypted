This package contains several Laravel utilities to work with encrypted data.

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require swisnl/laravel-encrypted-data
```

N.B. Using Laravel 6-8? Please use version [1.x](https://github.com/swisnl/laravel-encrypted-data/tree/1.x) of this package.

## Usage

### Models

> [!WARNING]
> Laravel supports [encrypted casts](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent-mutators#encrypted-casting) since version 8.12, so new projects should use that instead of the models provided by this package.
>
> We aim to provide a migration path to encrypted casts. See issue [#1](https://github.com/swisnl/laravel-encrypted-data/issues/1) for more information.
>

Extend `\Swis\Laravel\Encrypted\EncryptedModel` in your model and define the encrypted fields. Make sure your database columns are long enough, so your data isn't truncated!

``` php
protected $encrypted = [
    'secret',
];
```

You can now simply use the model properties as usual and everything will be encrypted/decrypted under the hood!

### Filesystem

Configure the storage driver in `config/filesystems.php`.

``` php
'disks' => [
    'local' => [
        'driver' => 'local-encrypted',
        'root' => storage_path('app'),
    ],
],
```

You can now simply use the storage methods as usual and everything will be encrypted/decrypted under the hood!

## Known issues/limitations

Due to the encryption, some issues/limitations apply:

1. Encrypted data is — depending on what you encrypt — roughly 30-40% bigger.

### Models

1. You can't query or order columns that are encrypted in your SQL-statements, but you can query or sort the results using collection methods;
2. All data is being serialized before it is encrypted — and unserialized after it is decrypted — so everything is stored exactly as how Laravel would insert it into the database. You can use [Eloquent Mutators](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/eloquent-mutators) as you normally would.

### Filesystem

1. You can't use the public disk as that will download the raw encrypted files, so using `Storage::url()` and `Storage::temporaryUrl()` does not make sense;
2. You can use streams with this disk, but internally we will always convert those to strings because the entire file contents need to be encrypted/decrypted at once.
